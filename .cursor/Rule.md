# Fundamental Principles
- Write clean, simple, readable code.
- Implement features in the simplest way possible.
- Keep files small and focused. (< 200 lines of code)
- Test after every meaningful change.
- Focus on core functionalities before optimizing.
- Use clear, consistent naming.
- Think thoroughly about the problem before writing any code. Wrtie 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write simple, clear, and modular code.
- use clear and easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.

# Error Fixing
- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- Explain the problem in plain English.
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines as possible.
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Web Search to find the latest up-to-date information.

# Building Process
- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it.
- Do NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple and modular approach.
- When not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a Web Search.

# Comments
- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code.
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong/obsolete.
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write well-documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOUR WRITE.
- When writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language. Write in short sentences.
