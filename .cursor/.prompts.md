Answer in short.

The fewer lines of code you write, the better.

Proceed like a Senior Developer.
Proceed like a 10x Developer.

DO NOT STOP WORKING ON THIS UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE.

Start by writing X reasoning paragraphs analyzing the problem. DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS.

DO NOT DELETE COMMENTS.

You should start the reasoning paragraphs with lots of uncertainty, and slowly gain confidence as you think about the problem.

# Summarize the current state
Before we proceed, I need you to give me a summary of the current state of the project.
Format this as 3 concise paragraphs, where you describe what we just did, what did not work, wich files were updated/created, what mistakes to avoid, any key insights/lessons we've learned, what problems/errors we are facing, ... and anything else a programmer might need to work productively on this project.
Write in a conversational yet informative tone, something like a README.md file on github that is super informative, dense and without any fluff or noise.
Do Not include any assumptions or theories. Just the facts.
I Expect to see three concise paragraphs, written as if you were giving instructions to another developer.

# Objective 50/50
BEFORE YOU ANSWER, I want you to write 2 detailed paragraphs, one arguing for each of these solutions. DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. Seriously consider both approaches.
Then, after you finish, tell me whether one of the solutions is obviously better than the other, and why.
